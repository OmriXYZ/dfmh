The first project I built in **spring boot**, a web application, gives the user the ability to upload donations he wants to donate.\
Some of the services I use:

  1. Registration and login system
  2. Upload image files to a donation form
  3. Add/Update/Delete objects (CRUD)
  4. Roles for users with defined privileges
  5. Using amazon services:
      1. Elastic Beanstalk - Run and manage Web Apps
      2. S3 - Scalable Storage in the Cloud
      3. RDS - Amazon Relational Database Service (Integrating with MySQL)
  6. Messaging between users
  7. Email verification
